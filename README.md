#News Application v2.0

It is my next (and working) version "News" application. This time without Spring using, based on Core Java and News API Client from API documentation.

Required application features:
1. Uses the public API https://newsapi.org
2. Download articles from the business category for Poland .
3. Saves the downloaded articles to the text file in the format "title: description: author".

My comments:
1. I used Gradle to build the application.
2. I used API Client from: https://github.com/KwabenBerko/News-API-Java

To do:
1. Better method separation.
2. Parsing articles data without null values.
3. Write tests.
