#News Application v2.0

It is second version of "News" application. This time based on Core Java and News API Client from API documentation.

Required application features:
1. Uses the public API https://newsapi.org
2. Download articles from the business category for Poland .
3. Saves the downloaded articles to the text file in the format "title: description: author".

My comments:
1. I used Gradle to build the application.
2. I used API Client from: https://github.com/KwabenBerko/News-API-Java

To do:
1. Better method separation.
